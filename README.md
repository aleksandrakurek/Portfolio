My website portfolio.

20.06.2016
The site is finished :) There can be still some bugs, so I would appreciate the feedback!

It's simple website where I will put my finished projects & it can be used as a contact page.

Its fully RWD.
I used here HTML5, CSS3, jQuery (for scrolling and portfolio-gallery) and Bootstrap layout.
There are CSS3 animation for bouncy arrow and header title.

Check it out here --->  http://aleksandrakurek.github.io/Portfolio/

Feel free to contact with me- I'd love to hear what you think about it!
